## Portfolio Reflection – CS 230

### Client Summary and Software Requirements
The client for this project was **The Gaming Room**, a company seeking to expand their existing Android-based game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a web-based, multi-platform application. The software needed to support multiple teams and players per game, enforce unique identifiers and names, and operate in a distributed environment accessible from desktop and mobile devices. The client also required the system to be scalable, secure, and capable of supporting concurrent gameplay.

### Strengths in Documentation Development
One area I performed particularly well in was translating technical requirements into a clear and structured software design document. I effectively applied object-oriented principles and design patterns, such as the **Singleton pattern** and inheritance, to explain how the system manages game state, identifiers, and scalability. The Evaluation and Recommendations sections clearly compared operating platforms and justified architectural decisions.

### Value of the Design Process
Working through a formal design document was helpful because it required careful consideration of system architecture before implementation. Defining constraints, requirements, and relationships early made the code easier to reason about and reduced ambiguity during development. The domain model and UML diagram were especially useful for visualizing class interactions.

### Opportunities for Revision
If I were to revise one part of this project, I would expand the System Architecture View with a more detailed visual representation of the multi-tier architecture. Adding diagrams for client-server communication and data flow would improve clarity and make the document more useful for future developers.

### User-Centered Design Considerations
User needs were addressed by focusing on accessibility, performance, and consistency across platforms. By designing the application as a web-based system with responsive interfaces, the game can be used on both desktop and mobile devices without platform-specific limitations. Considering user needs is essential to ensure usability, scalability, and long-term success.

### Design Approach and Future Strategy
My approach to software design emphasized requirement analysis, modular architecture, and platform evaluation before coding. In future projects, I would continue using techniques such as UML modeling, platform comparison matrices, and iterative design reviews to ensure architectural decisions align with both user needs and system requirements.
